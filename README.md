I’m an aspiring **Software Engineer** who loves building tools, automation, and data-driven applications that solve real engineering problems.  
I’m graduated in **Bachelor of Information Technology (Honours) in Software Systems Development** with a **CGPA of 3.81**, and I enjoy working across the full stack — from backend logic and APIs to automation workflows and dashboards.

If a workflow is slow, messy, or manual… I *will* find a way to automate it 😎  
If a process needs insights… I *will* turn it into a dashboard.  
If a team struggles with visibility… I *will* build the system that fixes it.

### 🌟 My Motto  
> **Build it once. Improve it always. Automate everything.**
